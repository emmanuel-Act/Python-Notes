- Python is an easy to interpret and high-level object-oriented programming language with easy-to-read syntax. Ideal for prototyping and ad-hoc tasks, Python has wide use in scientific computing, web development, and automation. As a general-purpose, beginner-friendly programming language, Python supports many top computer scientists and application developers globally

- Want to hear a celebrity endorsement? Here's Peter Norvig, the director of research at Google: "Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning, and remains so as the system grows and evolves."

- It is important to understand all aspects of Python as an open source programming language. We'll discuss Python development, Python libraries, as well as some history and future trends. Read on to wrap your mind around this elegant, incredible language.
- Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
- It is used for:
  - web development (server-side),
  - software development,
  - mathematics,
  - system scripting.
## What can Python do?
  - Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
  - Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
  - Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
  - Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
  - Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
## Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
