# Python

# Function

- Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task.

- The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again. 

## Creating a Python Function
- We can create a  Python function     using the def keyword.
- Example:
    - def fun(): <br/>
      print("Welcome to GFG")  <br/>
